# B9lab ETH-SUB: Splitter

Small project and assisted by B9lab (https://academy.b9lab.com)


> You will create a smart contract named `Splitter` whereby:
>
>* there are 3 people: Alice, Bob and Carol.
>* we can see the balance of the Splitter contract on the Web page.
>* whenever Alice sends ether to the contract for it to be split, half of it goes to Bob and the other half to Carol.
>* we can see the balances of Alice, Bob and Carol on the Web page.
>* Alice can use the Web page to split her ether.
